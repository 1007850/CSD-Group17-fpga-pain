2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-134#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_B6B5_WARN  
Luts B6LUT and B5LUT in use in site SLICE_X47Y76 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-136#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_C6C5_WARN  
Luts C6LUT and C5LUT in use in site SLICE_X47Y76 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-142#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_B6B5_WARN  
Luts B6LUT and B5LUT in use in site SLICE_X46Y76 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 sm/D_debug_dff_q_reg has an input control pin sm/D_debug_dff_q_reg/ENARDEN (net: sm/D_debug_dff_q_reg_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_3) which is driven by a register (reset_cond/D_stage_q_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 sm/D_debug_dff_q_reg has an input control pin sm/D_debug_dff_q_reg/RSTRAMARSTRAM (net: sm/io_led_OBUF[2]) which is driven by a register (reset_cond/D_stage_q_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
