LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell sm/D_stage_q[3]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) fifo_reset_cond/D_stage_q_reg[0]/PRE, fifo_reset_cond/D_stage_q_reg[1]/PRE,
fifo_reset_cond/D_stage_q_reg[2]/PRE, fifo_reset_cond/D_stage_q_reg[3]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance brams/bram1/ram_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal
