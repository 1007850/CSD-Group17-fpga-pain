2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock slowclk_gen/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock slowclk_gen/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin slowclk_gen/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance brams/bram1/ram_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance brams/bram2/ram_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>
